# Bulk RNA-Seq project 

This is the R vignette and code of a Bulk RNA-Seq project. In this vignette we will start from a Recount table, whose counts derive from RNA-seq samples of human brain cells compared to pancreas and liver cells (see http://159.149.160.56/GT_files/July30/ and also https://gtexportal.org/home/).
